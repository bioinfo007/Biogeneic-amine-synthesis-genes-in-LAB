# Biogeneic-amine-synthesis-genes-in-LAB
**Overview**
This repository contains custom Python scripts developed for the comprehensive analysis of biogenic amine (BA) biosynthesis genes in lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Each analysis step is organized into a dedicated directory with all necessary scripts and input data provided for reproducibility.

**General Requirements**
Before running any scripts, ensure your environment has the following tools and Python packages installed:

**Required Software & Libraries**

**Python 3.7 or higher**

Biopython

pandas

numpy

seaborn

matplotlib

scipy

statsmodels

You can install the Python packages using: pip install biopython pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scipy statsmodels

**Notes**

Make sure paths in the scripts or command lines point correctly to your input data directories/files.

It is recommended to run these scripts in a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.

Scripts include comments and logging for troubleshooting.
